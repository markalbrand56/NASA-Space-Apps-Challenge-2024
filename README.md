### Project Description

#### What exactly does it do?

Our project is a web application made to display a gallery of images taken by the James Webb Space Telescope, accompanied by a musical composition generated from the data of the images. The user can navigate through the gallery and listen to the music, reading the information about the images while enjoying the experience.

#### What do you hope to achieve with it?

We hope to create an immersive experience for the user, combining the beauty of the images taken by the James Webb Space Telescope with the music generated from the data of the images. This will allow the user to appreciate the images in a different way, and to learn more about the universe and the telescope.

#### What did you use to build it?

Our frontend is built with React and Vite, deployed on Netlify and setup with the custom domain offered by Godaddy and Porkbun for this event. We setup the domain with Cloudflare for SSL and DNS management.

For our backend we deployed a server on AWS EC2, with a Pocketbase backend running in it. This allowed us to store the images and descriptions in a database and serve them to the frontend. This process of uploading the images and descriptions was done manually on our team, to ensure the quality of the data.
